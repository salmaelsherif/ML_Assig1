# Machine Learning Coursera Assignments Solutions (Python)
This repositry contains the python versions of the programming assignments for the course of 
[Machine Learning by Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

The assignments use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
